# SmallReactShop

This is an old project I made to try out React.  
Itâ€™s unfinished and was only meant as a **practice/training project** for learning purposes.

## how to use
1. **Clone the repository**
git clone https://github.com/altin-demku/smallreactshop.git
cd smallreactshop

2. **Start project**
npm start
