# SmallReactShop

This is an old project I made to try out React.
Itâ€™s unfinished and was only meant as a **practice/training project** for learning purposes.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/altin-demku/smallreactshop.git
cd smallreactshop
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server**
```
npm start
```
